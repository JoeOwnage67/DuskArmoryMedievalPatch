**DESCRIPTION**

I made this patch to make Dusk Armory Medieval style assets be available at Medieval tech level.  Higher tech items remain locked at higher tech levels.

**CHANGES:**
- Created Dusk Armory research tab with Medieval style apparel and blades research.
- Made some small changes to workToMake ticks and recipes.
- Made some changes to Dusk Helmet to make it a Dusk Helm. Dusk Helmet remains available at higher tech levels but will use the same art.
- Moved Cloak to VFEC_OuterShell layer from Vanilla Expanded Framework.
